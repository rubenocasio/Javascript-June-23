/* 
  Given to me (Neil) in an interview
  Given a string
  What is it about a string that makes it possible for it to become a palindrome?


  A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads
  the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
  
  return whether or not it's possible to make a palindrome out of the string's
  characters.

const str1 = "";
const expected1 = false;

const str2 = "a";
const expected2 = true;

const str3 = "ddaa";
const expected3 = true;
// Explanation: "daad" or "adda"

const str4 = "dda";
const expected4 = true;
// Explanation: "dad"

const str5 = "aaadd";
const expected5 = true;
// Explanation: "daaad"

const str6 = "abc";
const expected6 = false;

/* READ HERE
For a string to be able to be re-ordered into a palindrome
It must have an even occurrence of every character
Unless it is odd length, then it can have 1 character that
can have an odd number of occurrences.
Another way to look at it would be, if you cancel out ever char that has a pair,
it can be a palindrome if you are left with 0 or 1 char remaining:
- "dad" the "d" cancels with itself to leave "a"
- "daad" the "d" and "a" cancel with itself to leave nothing
- "daam" the "a" cancels with itself leaving "dm", more than 1 char remaining, can't be palindrome

/**
 * This same approach can be done with an array, using .indexOf instead

 * slower that way because .indexOf and .splice would be a nested loops.
 * - Time: O(n) linear, n = str.length.
 * - Space: O(n) linear.
